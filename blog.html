                <h2>Day 2</h2>
                <p>After an entire day spent nursing a migraine, and another working full tilt at the day job, the extent of my coding today consisted of creating a new <b>branch</b> for managing changes to this blog. </p>
                <h2>Day 1</h2>
                <p>Finally getting around to starting 100 days of code. After two horribly busy months at the day job, I can finally spend some time this weekend coding.
                I am starting with a very basic static site, with the hopes that it will improve with time.
                The main goal for today was to get this page up and running on GitHub Pages using a custom domain. Thankfully, this process was pretty painless, thanks to Porkbun Domains (mainly chosen for adorable pig logo.)</p>
